Stargazer - Static Website (Prototype)
====================================

What this is
------------
A static, accessible prototype website for Stargazer Clothing built to be opened locally (e.g., in Visual Studio Code) or deployed to any static host. It's intended as a starting point before connecting a real Shopify store and Mailchimp form actions.

Files
-----
- index.html — main page (HTML + semantic structure + accessibility features)
- styles.css — navy & silver brand styles, responsive layout
- enquiry.html - information fill up form
- products.html — sample product data
- README.md — this file

How to use
----------
1. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Use the Live Server extension (or open index.html in a browser).
3. Products are loaded from products.json. In production you will replace this with Shopify product data or use Shopify's Storefront API.
4. Mailchimp and Shopify integration are placeholders — README notes where to plug them in.

Domain & Analytics
------------------
Planned domain: www.stargazerclothing.com
Add Google Analytics / GA4 snippet and verify domain ownership once deployed.
